    <li>When the time comes - throw there all of your pelmenis. Do not close the pan as they will look more like boiled one. And we don't want that, do we? </li>
    <li>As long as pelmeni don't have fried skin we can prepare our souce</li>
    <li>For that we need two ingridients:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>catchup</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Just mix them all and we have our adorable souce.</li>
    <li>Now your pelmeni must be ready already, just put them in the plate, add souce and voala!.. It's prepared</li>
